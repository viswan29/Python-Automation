This script is to automatically retrieve the cricket scores from the cricclubs website for a particular ClubID(tournament). 
I have used Python Pandas library to get the html table content and then do data manipulation to get Batsmen data, Bowler data and Match Statistics.
This script will finally output one excel file with three sheets i.e. Batsmen Data, Bowler Data and Match Details. 
This data can be used for analytics or to feed to any machine learning algorithms
